This is a project that is intended to be a simple proof of concept app to help create and update a pregnancy plan.  After specifying the username, the user will be interacting with a LLM to create a multi-step plan for the pregnancy.  The plan will be manifested as a document that will always be shown to the user and downloadable at any time.

We need - 
- a backend that allows for streaming the chat
- - optionally a command line mode where we can continue to test / iterate on the items
- a frontend that will connect to the backend and display both the pregnancy plan and the chat
